# CMSC203 Lab10 - Graphing a Function

 
Concepts tested by this program:
	
+ Inheritance
+ Interfaces
+ Polymorphism
+ Abstract classes
+ Overriding methods
+ Graphing with JavaFX
 
NOTE: This lab requires attention to detail. Follow the following instructions carefully.

When computing limits, it is sometimes not obvious whether a limit exists simply by studying the function.  Graphing the function and viewing it may sometimes help. In this lab, you will use and extend an application that graphs several functions. Refer to Task #0 through Task #3 below for specific instructions.

## Operation

+ When the user selects the “Graph a Function” button, the application will display a list of functions and ask the user to select one of them to plot.  
+ The application will then ask the user for the left and right extents (i.e., between what values of x will the function be plotted), from which it will calculate the maximum and minimum values of the function that will be displayed.
+ Then the application will transform the function to the coordinate system of the display and plot it.
+ The user may then re-graph the same or a different function, or exit.
